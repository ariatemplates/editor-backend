Mode manager

__The name is maybe not the best one. It should be more document (code documents) manager. Maybe even split the two, creating a document manager using the mode manager.__





# Documentation

The mode manager does two jobs:

- it manages _documents_, through what we call _sessions_
- it manages _modes_, they can be added to the manager and are then available for documents

### Modes

You can add modes to the mode manager, giving several names for those modes for more flexibility.

The modes are referenced by documents through those names, and are used to apply actual services on those documents.

### Documents

Documents can be initialized through this module: you need to specify which mode the document will use (among the available modes).

After initialization, a unique id is given for this document. This is mandatory to keep it, because this is what is used to refer to a document.

Then you can call mode services against a document by giving the id of this document and the name of the service, along with proper arguments. The underlying document's mode's service will be called on this document.
