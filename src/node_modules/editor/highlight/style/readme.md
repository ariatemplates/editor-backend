## Constructor

The constructor accepts only one input value. However, this value can be of different types, this is explained below.

If the value is a `String` or a `Number`, it is considered as the input for the `color` property.

Otherwise, if this is an `Object`, here are the expected properties: 

- `color`
	- type: `Color`
- `background`
	- type: `Color`
- `font`
	- type: `Font`

Note that properties that can be specified for `font` and `color` can be directly put in this object, they won't clash.
