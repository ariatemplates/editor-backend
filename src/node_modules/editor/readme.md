Common resources for modes.

# File system layout

- [`readme.md`](./readme.md): the main documentation file

Services:

- [`highlight`](./highlight)
- [`outline`](./outline)

Parsing: 

- [`pegjs-parser`](./pegjs-parser): common resources used by parsers generated with PEG.js

Models:

- [`mode`](./mode): interface to all the services a mode can provide
- [`code`](./code): provides various models/representations and operations related to a source code
- [`session`](./session): a module to handle generically sessions, that is a data store working with ids as input
- [`modeManager/`](./modeManager/): a module managing modes and documents





# Documentation

The editor module is the __unique__ entry point for code edition services.

For now, concretely it creates and exports an instance of a mode manager configured properly.

It adds to this manager all the modes already implemented.





# Backlog

## Use a more generic parser class

__For now the only standard Parser is designed too closely to PEG.js based parsers.__

We can see it in the definition of the [`Code`](./code.js) class, which accepts as input a parser. The only `Parser` class that could be used for the schema definition was the one inside the [`pegjs-parser`](./pegjs-parser) module.

Either externalize this class, or add an intermediate layer.

## Use the graph

For now, all features are implemented considering only an entire source code.

In the future, for better consistency, simplicity, performances and logic, everything should be working with the graph model, built from the AST.

For instance, a node could be attached the `foldable` property, the `type` property being already present and used for highlighting.

However, the algorithms already implemented will be useful to handle whole changes: these changes modify portions of graphs, it's like an entire source code, but nested in another.

One big thing will be handling slight changes in the graph, and updating the model in a minimum time.
