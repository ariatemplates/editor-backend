# Documentation

A wrapper for PEG.js generated parsers.

This module is an adapter for parsers generated by PEG.js.

It's a wrapper class that will know how to make the parsing service defined for _modes_ work with such kind of parser.

___Pending concept___: the rest of this section needs review and work

It uses the generated parser to parse an input, and then is able to do some post-processing, and so on.

You can either use it, in this case it's more or less like using the generated parser, or sub-class it, to implement post-processing.

## Post-processing

The generated parser does really little things. It's almost like a token wrapper, just ordering them into a tree.

It is really hard to do a lot in the grammar, which has a limited concept, and is stuck to be used through a DSL.

The post-processing is there to do several things:

- fix
- compute
- re-arrange
- transform
- ...
