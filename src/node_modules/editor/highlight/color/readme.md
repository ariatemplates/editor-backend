# Documentation

There are different physical models to represent a color: RGB, HSV, ...

Our class implements for now RGB colors and provides:

- construction
- factories

No validation is made for now.

To create a color, either call the constructor or a factory.

# API

## Methods

### Constructor

#### Parameters

- `spec`
	- type: `Object`, `Number` or `String`. See below for more information.
	- Provides the values for red, green and blue. See below for more information.

`spec`:

- `Object`
	- `r`: the red component
	- `g`: the green component
	- `b`: the blue component
- `Number`: a gray scale, equivalent to setting all the _rgb_ components to the same given value.
- `String`: the name of a predefined color (please refer to the code for those)

Note that a color component, as well as the gray scale then, must be provided as an integer value comprised between `0` and `255`.





# Backlog

- move helper function `ensureRange` to the internal `std` library, in `maths`
- accept HSV & co. format
- add conversion methods (probably use a third-party module) between color specifications formats
- for the parsing of a color: if custom parsing fails, try to parse the input as _more standard_ objects, like arrays or objects. If it works, use the result as input for the constructor.
