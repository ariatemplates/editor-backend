## Methods

### Constructor

#### Parameters

1. `language`
	- type: `String`, `Null`, `Any`
	- __in__
	- The language to which this node belongs to. It is likely to be a string, but you can use any value you want, except `void` because this parameter is required. You can even use `null` to indicate that the language is unknown, or non-relevant for now.
1. `element`
	- type: `String`, `Null`, `Any`
	- __in__
	- The type of the element for the language this node belongs to. It is likely to be a string, but you can use any value you want, except `void` because this parameter is required. You can even use `null` to indicate that the type is unknown, or non-relevant for now.
1. `line`
	- type: `Number`
	- __in__
	- The number of the line where the element starts.
1. `column`
	- type: `Number`
	- __in__
	- The number of the column where the element starts.
1. `index`
	- type: `Number`
	- __in__
	- The number of the character - 0-based index of the total input - where the element starts.

#### Backlog

- maybe we should use the `Range` type instead of `Location`, but this might be too heavy for the purpose...
