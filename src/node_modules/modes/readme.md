_modes_ are modules implementing source code edition services for specific languages.

Modes might use each other.





# File system layout

Documentation: 

- [`readme.md`](./readme.md): the main documentation file
- [`parser.md`](./parser.md): an article about how to create a parser

__All sub folders are modes, please refer to their respective documentations for more details.__

## Parser creation

This section describes the choices made to create parsers when this is needed.

### Requirements

Here are the requirements of the parser:

- generate at least a tree
- keep location information, both as ranges (indexes in the full string of code) and coordinates (line/column model)
- ...

### Choice

As all the points mentioned above involve a strong knowledge of both the language we want to manage and the theory of formal languages, we won't have time to totally proceed like this.

We will refer to a strong power which is the community.

One of the most famous tool to generate parsers in JavaScript is [PEG.js](http://pegjs.majda.cz/). It uses the [parsing expression grammar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) model, which is apparently more powerful than other more traditional ones.

## Development

You can either work on the common library for modes in `node_modules` or on a specific mode.

Please refer to the respective documentations.

## Node ids for outline

__Add node ids to outline nodes and allow _contextual_ requests.__

For performances issues essentially, we should be able to work with partial parts of the outline model. Whether it is for update, or just data requests.

With a node id, the backend would be able to know with which node it is going to work. That way, the client would be able to request outline data for a given node.

For even more performances, a depth level of the requested subtree could be passed: this way the backend would send only a few nodes, with proper ids, and the client would request their own subtrees if needed, passing the ids.

## Documentation

- Put the article in [`parser.md`](./parser.md) about the parser creation process in the wiki
- Write an article more specifically about PEG.js
	- description, links to resources
	- how I use it in the project (how I prefer structuring the grammar, using the initializer, ...)
	- what interesting things I learned about PEG.js (which are not obvious): like the possibility to call a specific rule with the `parse` method
	- which version I use
